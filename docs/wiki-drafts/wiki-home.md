# Claude Memory Wiki

Welcome to the Claude Memory documentation wiki! This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic usage to advanced development workflows.

## üìö What is Claude Memory?

Claude Memory is a universal memory system that transforms AI conversations into persistent project intelligence. It enables AI assistants (particularly Claude) to maintain context across sessions, making them true development partners rather than stateless tools.

## üí° Why Claude Memory?

Traditional AI assistants lose context between sessions, requiring developers to repeatedly explain their project. Claude Memory solves this by:

1. **Persisting Context**: All project decisions, patterns, and progress saved
2. **Reducing Token Usage**: Optimized context prevents repeated explanations
3. **Enabling Handoffs**: Perfect for team collaboration and AI switching
4. **Tracking Evolution**: See how your project develops over time
