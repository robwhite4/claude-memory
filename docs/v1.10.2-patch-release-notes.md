# Claude Memory v1.10.2 Patch Release Notes

**Release Date**: June 15, 2025  
**Type**: Patch Release (Bug Fix)

## 🐛 Bug Fix

### Report Command `--type` Flag Handling (Issue #48)

**Problem**: The report command was incorrectly handling the `--type` flag syntax, resulting in a confusing error message.

**Before v1.10.2**:
```bash
$ claude-memory report --type progress
❌ Unknown report type: --type
Available types: summary, tasks, patterns, decisions, progress, sprint
```

**After v1.10.2**:
```bash
$ claude-memory report --type progress
# Progress Report

## 📈 Progress Overview
...
```

## ✨ What's Fixed

- Both syntax options now work correctly:
  - Positional: `claude-memory report progress`
  - Flag: `claude-memory report --type progress`
- Added proper argument parsing when `--type` is used as a flag
- Improved consistency with other CLI commands
- Added test coverage for both syntax variations

## 📦 Installation

Update to the latest version:
```bash
npm update -g claude-memory
```

Or install fresh:
```bash
npm install -g claude-memory@1.10.2
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

The fix detects when `--type` is passed as the positional argument and properly extracts the actual report type from the subsequent arguments. This ensures both the documented flag syntax and the traditional positional syntax work as expected.

## 🧪 Testing

All tests pass including the new test case specifically for the `--type` flag syntax. The fix has been validated across all supported Node.js versions (16.x, 18.x, 20.x) and operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows).

## 🚀 What's Next

This patch release continues our commitment to CLI usability improvements. Future enhancements being tracked:
- Issue #50: Improved argument parsing for invalid flag values
- Issue #51: Consistent quiet mode behavior across commands
- Issue #52: Warnings for unsupported flags

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Thanks to the community for reporting this issue and helping improve the Claude Memory CLI experience.
