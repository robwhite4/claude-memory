[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g claude-memory

# Initialize in any project
cd your-project
claude-memory init

# Start using immediately
echo "Load project memory and help me with development"
```

## 🎯 What This Solves

**Before Claude Memory:**
```
You: "Help me deploy this app"
Claude: "What's your tech stack? What deployment platform?"
You: [5 minutes explaining context from scratch]
```

**After Claude Memory:**
```
You: "Load project memory and help with deployment"
Claude: "I see this is a Node.js app with AWS ECS. Based on our 
previous deployment pattern, I'll check the Docker config first..."
```

## 🧠 Core Features

- **🔄 Persistent Memory**: Claude remembers everything across sessions
- **📋 Decision Tracking**: Why every choice was made, with alternatives
- **🧩 Pattern Learning**: AI gets smarter by learning from your project
- **🔍 Smart Search**: Find any decision, pattern, or knowledge instantly
- **📝 Living Documentation**: CLAUDE.md stays current automatically
- **🚀 Zero Setup**: Works immediately after one command

## 📦 Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g claude-memory
```

### Per-Project Installation
```bash
npm install claude-memory
npx claude-memory init
```

### Alternative Installation
```bash
# Via yarn
yarn global add claude-memory

# Via pnpm  
pnpm add -g claude-memory
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Initialize Memory in Any Project
```bash
cd your-project
claude-memory init

# Or specify project name
claude-memory init "My Amazing App"
```

### The Magic Phrase
Every conversation with Claude should start with:
> **"Load project memory and [your task]"**

### CLI Commands
```bash
# View project intelligence
claude-memory stats

# Search knowledge base
claude-memory search "authentication"

# Manual operations (usually automatic)
claude-memory decision "Use PostgreSQL" "Better JSON support"
claude-memory pattern "Test locally first" "Prevents production issues"

# Session management
claude-memory session start "Feature Development"
claude-memory session end "Authentication completed"

# Backup and export
claude-memory backup
claude-memory export data.json
```

## 📁 What Gets Created

## 🎨 Project Examples

### Web Development
```bash
cd my-web-app
claude-memory init "E-commerce Platform"

# Tell Claude:
"Load project memory and implement user authentication"
```

### Data Science
```bash
cd ml-project
claude-memory init "Customer Analytics"

# Tell Claude:
"Load project memory and optimize the prediction model"
```

### DevOps/Infrastructure
```bash
cd infrastructure
claude-memory init "Kubernetes Cluster"

# Tell Claude:
"Load project memory and troubleshoot the deployment pipeline"
```

## 🏢 Team Usage

### Shared Intelligence
```bash
# Commit CLAUDE.md to share team knowledge
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Update project intelligence"

# New developers get instant context
git clone project-repo
cd project-repo
claude-memory stats  # See accumulated intelligence
```

### Onboarding Automation
New team members read `CLAUDE.md` and understand:
- Why every architectural decision was made
- What patterns work best for this project
- Current project context and conventions

## 🔄 Cross-Project Benefits

Intelligence learned in one project improves ALL projects:

```bash
# Pattern learned in Project A
"Always validate API inputs early to prevent downstream errors"

# Automatically applied in Project B when working on APIs
# Knowledge compounds across your entire development workflow
```

## 📊 Memory Statistics

📊 Claude Memory Statistics

Sessions: 15
Decisions: 23
Patterns: 8
Actions: 156
Knowledge Items: 34 (6 categories)

🕒 Recent Sessions:
  • API Optimization (2025-06-01)
  • Database Migration (2025-05-30)
  • Security Audit (2025-05-29)

🤔 Recent Decisions:
  • Use Redis for session storage
  • Implement JWT with refresh tokens
  • Deploy with blue-green strategy
```

## 🔍 Smart Search

```bash
claude-memory search "authentication"
```

```
🔍 Search results for: "authentication"

📋 Decisions:
  • Implement JWT authentication (2025-05-30)
    More secure than session cookies, supports microservices

🧩 Patterns:
  • Validate tokens early in middleware: Prevents unauthorized access

💡 Knowledge:
  • [security] JWT_SECRET: Stored in environment variables
  • [config] AUTH_TIMEOUT: 15 minutes for security
```

## 📈 ROI & Cost Benefits

### Time Savings
**Time saved per developer:**
- Context switching: 25 min/week
- Repeated explanations: 1.75 hours/week
- Finding old decisions: 55 min/week
- **Total: 2.75 hours/week per developer**

**10-person team: $140,000/year value at $100/hour**

### AI Usage Cost Reduction
**With Claude Code/AI Assistants:**
- **Traditional**: Claude re-explores entire codebase each session
- **With claude-memory**: Claude reads compact CLAUDE.md (~2KB) for instant context
- **Result**: ~40-60% reduction in AI tokens after initial setup week
- **Cost trajectory**: Higher Week 1 (building memory) → Much lower Week 2+ (leveraging memory)

**Example cost impact:**
- Day 1-7: Slightly higher (building project intelligence)
- Day 8+: Significantly lower (focused conversations vs. repeated exploration)
- Long-term: More efficient development with dramatically reduced context-building costs
