## 🤖 Set and Forget

Claude Memory runs automatically in the background, maintaining perfect context for AI assistants without any manual intervention.

```bash
# Install once
npm install -g claude-memory

# Initialize and forget
claude-memory init

# That's it! Claude now has persistent memory
```

## 🎯 The Problem It Solves

**Without Claude Memory** - Every conversation starts from zero:
```
You: "Continue working on the auth system"
AI: "What framework? What auth method? Where are the files?"
You: *10 minutes explaining everything again...*
```

**With Claude Memory** - AI knows your project instantly:
```
You: "Continue working on the auth system" 
AI: "I see you're using NextAuth with JWT. Last session you completed 
the login flow. The remaining tasks are password reset and 2FA. 
Should I start with the password reset endpoint you stubbed in 
/api/auth/reset.ts?"
```

## 🪄 How It Works (Automatically)

### 1. **Auto-Session Management**
Sessions start and rotate automatically every 4 hours, organizing your work by time of day:
- Morning Development (6am-12pm)
- Afternoon Development (12pm-5pm)
- Evening Development (5pm-9pm)
- Night Development (9pm-6am)

### 2. **Auto-Backups**
Your project memory is automatically backed up:
- After every 10 significant actions
- When sessions rotate
- Daily on first activity
- Keeps 7 days of history

### 3. **Token-Optimized Context**
CLAUDE.md is automatically optimized to include only:
- Current session info
- Recent decisions (last 3-5)
- Active tasks and high-priority items
- Recent completions for continuity
- Critical patterns only

### 4. **Zero Configuration**
Default settings work perfectly for most projects:
```json
{
  "autoSession": true,
  "autoSessionHours": 4,
  "autoBackup": true,
  "backupInterval": 10,
  "tokenOptimization": true
}
```

## 📦 What Gets Created

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI-readable project context (commit this!)
└── .claude/
    ├── memory.json    # Full memory database (gitignored)
    ├── config.json    # Your preferences
    ├── backups/       # Automatic backups
    └── context/       # Full context files (v1.7.0+)
        ├── knowledge.md   # Complete knowledge base
        ├── patterns.md    # All patterns with details
        ├── decisions.md   # Full decision history
        └── tasks.md       # Detailed task information
```

## 🚀 Basic Usage (Manual Commands)

While Claude Memory works automatically, you can also use manual commands:

```bash
# Check what Claude knows
cmem stats

# Add important decisions
cmem decision "Use PostgreSQL" "Need ACID compliance" "MongoDB,DynamoDB"

# Track patterns
cmem pattern "API-first design" "Build APIs before UI" 0.9 high

# Manage tasks
cmem task add "Implement user settings" --priority high
cmem task complete abc123 "Added settings page"

# Search your memory
cmem search "authentication"
```

## 🔧 Claude-Code Integration

For [claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) users, memory is automatically included:

```bash
# Get current context as JSON
cmem context

# Returns:
{
  "session": "Afternoon Development",
  "activeTasks": [...],
  "recentDecisions": [...],
  "openPatterns": [...]
}
```

This context is automatically injected into your Claude conversations, giving perfect continuity without any extra tokens or manual steps.

## 💰 Token Efficiency

Claude Memory significantly reduces token usage by eliminating repeated context. The token optimization feature intelligently manages context size while preserving critical information.

**Typical savings scenarios:**
- **Quick questions about ongoing work**: Minimal context needed, maximum savings
- **Continuing previous sessions**: No need to re-explain project structure or decisions
- **Team handoffs**: Shared context eliminates lengthy explanations

When token optimization is enabled (default), CLAUDE.md stays concise while maintaining full context in the memory system.

## 📂 Multi-File Context System (v1.7.0+)

Claude Memory now preserves complete information without truncation through a multi-file context system:

### How It Works
- **CLAUDE.md**: Remains the primary context file, optimized for tokens
- **Context Files**: Full details stored in `.claude/context/` directory
- **No Information Loss**: Everything is preserved, just better organized

### Context Files
- **knowledge.md**: Complete knowledge base with all values untruncated
- **patterns.md**: All patterns with full descriptions and history
- **decisions.md**: Complete decision log with reasoning and outcomes
- **tasks.md**: Detailed task information including assignments and dates

### Benefits
- **Full Context Access**: AI can read specific context files when needed
- **Token Efficient**: Main CLAUDE.md stays under 3K tokens
- **Human Readable**: Well-organized markdown files for easy browsing
- **Git Friendly**: Context files can be tracked or ignored as needed

The CLAUDE.md file includes references to these context files, allowing AI assistants to request more detailed information when necessary.

## 🛠️ Configuration

Adjust behavior if needed:

```bash
# View current config
cmem config get

# Adjust settings
cmem config set autoSessionHours 6
cmem config set tokenOptimization false
cmem config set silentMode true
```

## 📊 Advanced Features

### Pattern Resolution
```bash
# Learn from problems
cmem pattern "Memory leak in useEffect" "Always cleanup subscriptions" 1.0 critical

# Document solutions
cmem pattern resolve abc123 "Added cleanup function to all effects"
```

### Session Control
```bash
# Manual session management (optional)
cmem session start "Feature: Payment Integration"
cmem session end "Completed Stripe integration"

# View history
cmem session list
```

### Import/Export
```bash
# Backup your entire memory
cmem export memory-backup.json

# Share memory with team
cmem export --sanitized team-memory.json
```

### AI Assistant Handoffs
```bash
# Generate comprehensive handoff summary
cmem handoff

# JSON format for programmatic use
cmem handoff --format=json

# Focus on specific information
cmem handoff --include=tasks
cmem handoff --include=decisions
```

Perfect for transitioning between AI assistants or team members. Includes active tasks, recent decisions, key patterns, and session context.

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Daily Development Flow
```bash
# Morning - Memory handles everything automatically
$ cd my-project
$ echo "Continue where I left off yesterday"
# Claude reads CLAUDE.md, knows exactly what you were doing

# Make decisions - Memory captures them
$ cmem decision "Switch to TypeScript" "Type safety for scale" "Keep JS"

# Track progress - Memory maintains context  
$ cmem task complete task-123 "Refactored auth module"

# Evening - Memory auto-rotates session with summary
# Everything saved, backed up, and ready for tomorrow
```

### Team Collaboration
```bash
# Developer A works on auth
$ cmem session start "Auth System Implementation"
# ... work happens, patterns learned, decisions made ...

# Developer B picks up the next day
$ cat CLAUDE.md  # Sees auth decisions, patterns, progress
$ echo "Continue auth implementation"
# Claude knows exactly what Developer A did
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Commit CLAUDE.md** - Share team knowledge
2. **Don't worry about sessions** - They manage themselves
3. **Document decisions** - Future you will thank you
4. **Track patterns** - Claude learns and improves
5. **Let it run** - The magic happens automatically
