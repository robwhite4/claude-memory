Always run npm run lint before publishing

### undefined (critical)
Make tools work without manual intervention - users should get value immediately

### undefined (critical)
When discovering bugs in released versions, ALWAYS: 1) Create GitHub issue first, 2) Fix on hotfix branch from main, 3) Release as patch version (x.x.1), 4) Cherry-pick to develop if needed. Never fix bugs directly on feature branches.

### undefined (high)
Using your own product reveals real usability issues and missing features

### undefined (high)
Commit curated knowledge (CLAUDE.md) but keep personal memory private (.claude/ folder)

### undefined (high)
Always pull after automated releases to stay current with package.json version bumps and changelog updates
