## Project Memory Guidelines

This project uses Claude Memory for development context. When contributing:

### For Individual Contributors

1. **Don't update project memory** unless specifically asked
2. **Document decisions in PR descriptions** instead of using `cmem decision`
3. **Report patterns in issues** rather than adding them directly

### For Maintainers

1. **Update memory after merging PRs**:
   ```bash
   cmem decision "Implemented feature X" "Reasoning from PR #123" "alternatives"
   cmem pattern "New pattern discovered" "Description" 0.9
   ```

2. **Keep memory clean**:
   - Remove test patterns before committing
   - Use clear, descriptive knowledge keys
   - Categorize knowledge appropriately

3. **Handle memory in releases**:
   - Update version knowledge after each release
   - Document major decisions and patterns
   - Clean up resolved patterns

### Memory Conflict Resolution

If you encounter merge conflicts in `.claude/context/`:
```bash
# Accept incoming changes
git checkout --theirs .claude/context/

# Re-add your memory updates
cmem knowledge add "your_addition" "value" --category appropriate
```
