# Claude Memory v1.6.0 Release Notes

## 🎉 100% User Feedback Addressed!

We're thrilled to announce Claude Memory v1.6.0, which completes our response to all user feedback from v1.4.0. This release addresses the final two issues (#8 and #9) bringing us to 100% completion of the original 9 usability improvements requested by our users.

## ✨ Major Features

### 🆘 Enhanced Help System (Issue #9)
The help system has been completely redesigned for better usability:

- **Contextual Help**: Use `claude-memory help <command>` for detailed command-specific help
- **Clean Layout**: Organized sections with emoji icons for easy navigation  
- **Smart Error Messages**: Typos now suggest similar commands (e.g., `tas` → "Did you mean: task?")
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Real-world workflows for common use cases
- **Better Discovery**: Commands are grouped logically with clear descriptions

**Try it out:**
```bash
claude-memory help              # New organized main help
claude-memory help task         # Detailed task management guide
claude-memory help pattern      # Pattern management guide
claude-memory help examples     # Common workflow examples
```

### 🛡️ CLAUDE.md Merge Strategy (Issue #8)
Never lose your manual edits again! The new merge system intelligently preserves your custom content:

- **Section Markers**: Add manual content between `<!-- BEGIN/END MANUAL SECTION: name -->` markers
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates timestamped backups before each update
- **Smart Merging**: Manual sections are preserved when CLAUDE.md regenerates
- **Backup Management**: Keeps last 5 CLAUDE.md backups automatically

**Example usage:**
```markdown
### Project Notes
<!-- BEGIN MANUAL SECTION: Project Notes -->
This content will be preserved across updates!
Add your custom notes, documentation, or reminders here.
<!-- END MANUAL SECTION: Project Notes -->
```
