## architecture
### Session_Architecture
**Value**: Sessions stored in memory.json, not individual files. Sessions folder exists but unused in current design. Session management uses in-memory storage with auto-session rotation every 4 hours. Auto-backup creates snapshots including sessions.
**Updated**: 2025-06-05T00:41:29.579Z

### code_refactoring_PR33
**Value**: Successfully refactored claude-memory.js from 2,828 lines into modular structure. Created lib/ directory with ClaudeMemory class and utilities. Reduced main file by 37% while maintaining backward compatibility. PR #33 merged to develop branch.
**Updated**: 2025-06-09T00:30:40.259Z

### code_structure_v1.9
**Value**: Refactored main file into modular structure: bin/claude-memory.js (1,770 lines), lib/ClaudeMemory.js (1,016 lines), lib/utils/ (134 lines total). No breaking changes, all tests passing.
**Updated**: 2025-06-08T21:40:58.681Z

### unified_design_v1.10.0
**Value**: Created unified design proposal addressing user feedback. Phase 1 (v1.10.0) focuses on export/import commands and bulk operations as foundation. Phase 2 (v1.11.0) adds knowledge editing and task dependencies. Phase 3 (v1.12.0) implements GitHub integration. All features build on shared JSON schemas to avoid duplication.
**Updated**: 2025-06-08T02:23:59.156Z

## design
### CLAUDE_Merge_Strategy
**Value**: Section-based merge system: !-- BEGIN MANUAL SECTION -- for user content, !-- BEGIN AUTO SECTION -- for generated content. Backup before writes, detect dirty state, preserve manual edits while updating auto content. Parse existing file to extract manual sections before regeneration.
**Updated**: 2025-06-05T01:02:14.772Z

## documentation
### wiki_documentation_complete
**Value**: Created comprehensive GitHub wiki with 12 new pages covering all aspects of Claude Memory v1.9.0. All wiki links use hyphenated format and all commands/configs are accurate.

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T00:27:29.759Z

## feedback
### Original_User_Feedback
**Value**: Claude-Memory v1.4.0 usability feedback covering 5 main areas: 1) Pattern management confusion with syntax issues, missing list command, no pattern IDs shown 2) Missing knowledge management system for storing implementation details 3) File sync issues with CLAUDE.md auto-updates overwriting manual edits 4) Limited search with no type filtering, sorting, or result formatting 5) Command discovery problems with long help text and limited examples.
