## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-09: Rebase feature branches after refactoring
**Decision**: Rebase feature branches after refactoring
**Reasoning**: After merging PR #33 (code refactoring), feature branches had conflicts due to structural changes. Used rebase strategy to update branches with new module structure, then reimplemented features cleanly.
**Alternatives Considered**: Cherry-pick commits, Merge with conflicts, Start fresh branches


### 2025-06-08: Install Claude Memory
**Decision**: Install Claude Memory
**Reasoning**: Enable persistent AI memory across sessions for better project intelligence
**Alternatives Considered**: Manual documentation, External tools, No memory system


### 2025-06-08: Use develop branch workflow for v1.9.0
**Decision**: Use develop branch workflow for v1.9.0
**Reasoning**: Created develop branch to collect all v1.9.0 changes before merging to main. This follows Git Flow pattern and allows independent PRs for each feature while maintaining clean main branch.
**Alternatives Considered**: Direct commits to main, Single large PR, Feature flags
