## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-04: Successfully rebased pattern subcommands on v1.4.1
**Decision**: Successfully rebased pattern subcommands on v1.4.1
**Reasoning**: Resolved merge conflicts and combined the advanced pattern subcommands structure with the v1.4.1 hotfixes, ensuring tasks are included in search and all ID display functionality works
**Alternatives Considered**: Restart from scratch, Create separate branch


### 2025-06-04: PR #10 is ready for merge
**Decision**: PR #10 is ready for merge
**Reasoning**: Completed comprehensive testing including security tests, functionality tests, linting fixes, and package installation verification. All tests pass and the PR addresses all 4 critical usability issues
**Alternatives Considered**: Merge immediately, Wait for additional review, Test more edge cases


### 2025-06-04: Implemented pattern subcommands structure
**Decision**: Implemented pattern subcommands structure
**Reasoning**: Successfully created flag-based pattern commands (add, list, search, resolve) with backward compatibility. Provides clearer syntax while maintaining existing functionality
**Alternatives Considered**: Implement without backward compatibility, Wait for user feedback first
