# Claude Project Memory

## Active Session
- **Current**: Afternoon Development
- **Started**: 2025-06-06
- **Project**: Claude Memory NPM Package

## Key Project Knowledge

### Critical Information
- **Project Name**: Claude Memory NPM Package
- **Claude Memory**: v1.7.0
- **Memory Created**: 2025-06-01

### Knowledge Base
#### feedback (1 items)
- **Original_User_Feedback**: Claude-Memory v1.4.0 usability feedback covering 5 main areas: 1) Pattern management confusion with syntax issues, missing list command, no pattern IDs shown 2) Missing knowledge management system for storing implementation details 3) File sync issues with CLAUDE.md auto-updates overwriting manual edits 4) Limited search with no type filtering, sorting, or result formatting 5) Command discovery problems with long help text and limited examples. User requested subcommands, better pattern syntax, knowledge management, CLAUDE.md merge strategy, and enhanced search with type filtering and JSON output.

#### progress (3 items)
- **Current_Status_v1.5.0**: âœ… COMPLETED (7/9 issues): Issues #1-7 covering pattern management fixes, knowledge management system, enhanced search functionality. ðŸ”„ REMAINING (2/9 issues): Issue #8 CLAUDE.md merge strategy, Issue #9 help/UX improvements. Original user feedback 78% addressed with v1.5.0 release. Next focus: Complete remaining UX issues for comprehensive user experience improvements.
- **Progress_Status_89_Percent**: 89% user feedback addressed (8/9 issues complete). Issue #8 CLAUDE.md merge strategy just completed successfully. Only Issue #9 (help/UX improvements) remains for 100% coverage. Ready for final sprint to complete all original v1.4.0 user feedback requirements.
- **v1.5.0_Completion_Status**: 100% complete - All 9 issues from user feedback addressed. PR #13 (Issue #9: Enhanced help) and PR #14 (Issue #8: CLAUDE.md merge) ready for review

#### features (1 items)
- **v1.5.0_Features**: Pattern subcommands (add/list/search/resolve), Knowledge management system with categories, Enhanced search with --type filtering (decisions/patterns/tasks/knowledge), JSON output with --json flag, Result limiting with --limit N, All backward compatible

#### architecture (1 items)
- **Session_Architecture**: Sessions stored in memory.json, not individual files. Sessions folder exists but unused in current design. Session management uses in-memory storage with auto-session rotation every 4 hours. Auto-backup creates snapshots including sessions.

#### status (6 items)
- **Parity_Status_v1.5.0**: GitHub: main branch up-to-date with v1.5.0 release and project knowledge documentation. NPM: v1.5.0 published and available. Local: repository at v1.5.0, global claude-memory v1.5.0 installed, all systems synchronized. Ready for Issues #8-9 development.
- **v1.6.0_Released**: Successfully released v1.6.0 with 100% user feedback addressed. PRs #13 (Issue #9: Enhanced help) and #14 (Issue #8: CLAUDE.md merge) merged. All tests passing.
- **v1.6.0_NPM_Published**: v1.6.0 successfully published to npm. Users can now install with 'npm install -g claude-memory' to get all improvements.
- ... and 3 more items

#### design (1 items)
- **CLAUDE_Merge_Strategy**: Section-based merge system: !-- BEGIN MANUAL SECTION -- for user content, !-- BEGIN AUTO SECTION -- for generated content. Backup before writes, detect dirty state, preserve manual edits while updating auto content. Parse existing file to extract manual sections before regeneration.

#### testing (6 items)
- **Merge_Test**: Testing the CLAUDE.md merge strategy to ensure manual sections are preserved during auto-updates
- **Test_Merge_System**: Testing the new merge implementation with local code
- **Merge_Test_2**: Second test to verify manual sections are preserved during updates
- ... and 3 more items

#### implementation (1 items)
- **Issue_8_Implementation**: Successfully implemented CLAUDE.md merge strategy with section markers (!-- BEGIN MANUAL SECTION: Name --), automatic backups to .claude/backups/CLAUDE-*.md, and intelligent merging that preserves manual content while updating auto-generated sections. System tested and operational - manual sections survive multiple auto-updates. All acceptance criteria met.

#### workflow (5 items)
- **github_workflow**: Professional GitHub workflow: 1) Ensure required labels exist (enhancement, bug, documentation, priority:*, cli, etc.), 2) Create issue with appropriate labels, 3) Create feature branch 'feature/issue-X-description', 4) Make changes on branch, 5) Run 'npm test' and 'npm run lint' before ANY commit, 6) Update version/CHANGELOG, 7) Commit with 'Fixes #X' references, 8) Push branch and create PR, 9) Verify all CI checks pass, 10) Merge PR to main, 11) Create and push version tag, 12) Verify NPM publish and GitHub release. Always: check/create labels, test before commit, reference issues, tag releases.
- **git_co_author**: Always include Rob White as co-author in commits: Co-Authored-By: Rob White robwhite4@yahoo.com
- **release_process**: Complete release process: 1) Create issues with labels, 2) Create feature branch, 3) Implement changes, 4) Run tests/lint before EVERY commit, 5) Update version in package.json, 6) Update CHANGELOG.md, 7) Commit with 'Fixes #X', 8) Push branch and create PR, 9) Verify CI passes, 10) Merge PR, 11) Create and push version tag, 12) NPM auto-publishes, 13) Create GitHub release with 'gh release create vX.Y.Z --latest', 14) Verify release order. Always: test before commit, create GitHub release immediately, use --latest flag.

### Open Patterns
#### Critical Priority
- **Fix linting before release**: Always run npm run lint before publishing (effectiveness: 1)
- **Automatic by default**: Make tools work without manual intervention - users should get value immediately (effectiveness: 1)
#### High Priority
- **Dogfooding validates design**: Using your own product reveals real usability issues and missing features (effectiveness: 0.95)
- **Selective git strategy**: Commit curated knowledge (CLAUDE.md) but keep personal memory private (.claude/ folder) (effectiveness: 0.9)
#### Medium Priority
- **Cost transparency builds trust**: Being upfront about initial costs vs long-term savings helps users make informed decisions (effectiveness: 0.85)


### Recently Resolved
- **Subcommand structure test**: Fully implemented with all subcommands working (2025-06-04)
- **Test install**: Test pattern completed - functionality verified (2025-06-06)
- **Merged functionality test**: Test pattern completed - functionality verified (2025-06-06)

## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-06: v1.8.0 development started
**Decision**: v1.8.0 development started
**Reasoning**: Version bumped to 1.8.0, --version flag implemented with tests. Following new version-first workflow. Issue #19 CLI flags enhancement underway.
**Alternatives Considered**: Skip version bump, Different flag first


### 2025-06-06: Ready for v1.8.0 development
**Decision**: Ready for v1.8.0 development
**Reasoning**: v1.7.0 is stable with all tests passing. Context file tests added. Test patterns cleaned up. Issue #19 created with proper labels for CLI flags enhancement.
**Alternatives Considered**: More v1.7.x patches, Different feature


### 2025-06-06: Plan CLI flags enhancement release
**Decision**: Plan CLI flags enhancement release
**Reasoning**: Missing standard CLI flags should be added as a minor version update (1.8.0) since they add new functionality without breaking changes. Group related flags into coherent releases rather than individual patches.
**Alternatives Considered**: Individual patches, Major version, Feature flags


### 2025-06-06: Merge PR #18 for v1.7.0 release
**Decision**: Merge PR #18 for v1.7.0 release
**Reasoning**: All tests passing, both issues addressed, clean implementation with no breaking changes. Multi-file context system provides full information preservation while maintaining token efficiency.
**Alternatives Considered**: Wait for review, Add more tests


### 2025-06-06: v1.7.0 implementation complete
**Decision**: v1.7.0 implementation complete
**Reasoning**: Successfully implemented multi-file context system and updated README token claims. Context files preserve full information while CLAUDE.md remains token-optimized. Ready for version update and PR.
**Alternatives Considered**: Delay release, Add more features
