## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-05: Finalize PRs #11 and #12 sequentially
**Decision**: Finalize PRs #11 and #12 sequentially
**Reasoning**: PR #11 (pattern subcommands) should be merged first as it builds on v1.4.1, then PR #12 (knowledge & search) can be rebased and merged. This avoids complex merge conflicts and maintains clear feature progression
**Alternatives Considered**: Merge both simultaneously, Merge PR #12 first


### 2025-06-05: Create PR #12 for knowledge management and enhanced search
**Decision**: Create PR #12 for knowledge management and enhanced search
**Reasoning**: These features address 60% of original user feedback and provide solid foundation for remaining UX improvements. Systematic approach allows for proper testing and review
**Alternatives Considered**: Bundle with UX improvements, Wait for pattern subcommands PR


### 2025-06-05: Address user feedback systematically via GitHub issues
**Decision**: Address user feedback systematically via GitHub issues
**Reasoning**: Breaking down the comprehensive v1.4.0 feedback into specific GitHub issues allows for better tracking, testing, and incremental delivery while maintaining quality
**Alternatives Considered**: Address everything in one large PR, Ignore feedback until later
