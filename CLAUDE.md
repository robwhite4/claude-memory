## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-05: Follow GitHub best practices
**Decision**: Follow GitHub best practices
**Reasoning**: Created feature branches and PRs for Issues #8 and #9 instead of direct commits. Ensures code review, CI validation, and clean history
**Alternatives Considered**: Direct commits to main, Merge without review


### 2025-06-05: Handoff after Issue #8 completion
**Decision**: Handoff after Issue #8 completion
**Reasoning**: Issue #8 CLAUDE.md merge strategy successfully implemented and tested. All systems working: section markers, backups, merge preservation. Ready for user to test progress in new session before tackling final Issue #9.
**Alternatives Considered**: Continue immediately with Issue #9, Create comprehensive tests first


### 2025-06-05: Issue #8 CLAUDE.md merge strategy completed
**Decision**: Issue #8 CLAUDE.md merge strategy completed
**Reasoning**: Successfully implemented intelligent merge system with section markers, automatic backups, and preservation of manual content. All acceptance criteria met: section markers work, manual edits preserved, conflicts avoided, backups created, no data loss. Ready for production deployment.
**Alternatives Considered**: Continue with more features, Focus on Issue #9 next
