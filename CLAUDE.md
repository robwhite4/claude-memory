## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-07: Implement CLI flags for better UX
**Decision**: Implement CLI flags for better UX
**Reasoning**: Issue #19 requires standard CLI flags for version info, output control, and verbosity. These are essential CLI features that users expect. Implemented 5 flags: --version, --quiet, --output, --no-color, --verbose with full test coverage
**Alternatives Considered**: Skip CLI flags, Partial implementation, Different flag names


### 2025-06-06: v1.8.0 development started
**Decision**: v1.8.0 development started
**Reasoning**: Version bumped to 1.8.0, --version flag implemented with tests. Following new version-first workflow. Issue #19 CLI flags enhancement underway.
**Alternatives Considered**: Skip version bump, Different flag first


### 2025-06-06: Ready for v1.8.0 development
**Decision**: Ready for v1.8.0 development
**Reasoning**: v1.7.0 is stable with all tests passing. Context file tests added. Test patterns cleaned up. Issue #19 created with proper labels for CLI flags enhancement.
**Alternatives Considered**: More v1.7.x patches, Different feature
