## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-05: Release v1.5.0 with pattern subcommands and knowledge management
**Decision**: Release v1.5.0 with pattern subcommands and knowledge management
**Reasoning**: Just merged PRs #11 and #12 which implement major features that address 60% of user feedback. These are substantial new capabilities (pattern subcommands, knowledge management system, enhanced search) that warrant a minor version bump according to semantic versioning
**Alternatives Considered**: Continue with v1.4.1, Wait for more features


### 2025-06-05: Finalize PRs #11 and #12 sequentially
**Decision**: Finalize PRs #11 and #12 sequentially
**Reasoning**: PR #11 (pattern subcommands) should be merged first as it builds on v1.4.1, then PR #12 (knowledge & search) can be rebased and merged. This avoids complex merge conflicts and maintains clear feature progression
**Alternatives Considered**: Merge both simultaneously, Merge PR #12 first


### 2025-06-05: Create PR #12 for knowledge management and enhanced search
**Decision**: Create PR #12 for knowledge management and enhanced search
**Reasoning**: These features address 60% of original user feedback and provide solid foundation for remaining UX improvements. Systematic approach allows for proper testing and review
**Alternatives Considered**: Bundle with UX improvements, Wait for pattern subcommands PR
