## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-04: Implemented pattern subcommands structure
**Decision**: Implemented pattern subcommands structure
**Reasoning**: Successfully created flag-based pattern commands (add, list, search, resolve) with backward compatibility. Provides clearer syntax while maintaining existing functionality
**Alternatives Considered**: Implement without backward compatibility, Wait for user feedback first


### 2025-06-04: Created PR #10 for v1.4.1 hotfixes
**Decision**: Created PR #10 for v1.4.1 hotfixes
**Reasoning**: All 4 critical usability issues implemented and ready for review. PR includes comprehensive testing, documentation updates, and GitHub issue references for auto-closure on merge
**Alternatives Considered**: Wait for more testing, Create separate PRs for each issue


### 2025-06-04: Successfully implemented v1.4.1 hotfixes
**Decision**: Successfully implemented v1.4.1 hotfixes
**Reasoning**: Completed all 4 GitHub issues: fixed pattern parsing, ensured ID display, improved search to include tasks, and added pattern list command. All changes are in fix/v1.4.1-hotfixes branch and ready for PR
**Alternatives Considered**: Continue working on other issues, Implement in main branch directly
