## Recent Decisions Log

### 2025-06-07: Create GitHub Wiki
**Decision**: Create GitHub Wiki
**Reasoning**: Create comprehensive GitHub Wiki to document project architecture, development workflows, planning roadmap, and detailed guides. This provides better organization than cramming everything into README and gives space for in-depth documentation that helps contributors and advanced users.
**Alternatives Considered**: Keep docs in repo only, Use GitHub Discussions, Expand README instead


### 2025-06-07: Plan before code
**Decision**: Plan before code
**Reasoning**: All development work should start with proper GitHub planning: milestones for releases, issues for features/bugs, and project boards for tracking. This ensures transparency, enables collaboration, and maintains professional standards.
**Alternatives Considered**: Ad-hoc development, Internal planning only, Start coding immediately


### 2025-06-07: Branch cleanup strategy
**Decision**: Branch cleanup strategy
**Reasoning**: Enable GitHub auto-delete for merged branches and clean up existing stale branches. This prevents repository clutter and makes it easier to see active work. Auto-delete is safer than manual cleanup.
**Alternatives Considered**: Manual cleanup only, Leave branches as history, Create cleanup script
