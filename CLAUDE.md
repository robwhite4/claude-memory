# Claude Project Memory

## Active Session
- **Current**: No active session
- **Started**: 2025-06-03
- **Project**: Claude Memory NPM Package

## Key Project Knowledge

### Critical Information
- **Project Name**: Claude Memory NPM Package
- **Claude Memory**: v1.0.0
- **Memory Created**: 2025-06-01

### Open Patterns
#### Critical Priority
- **Fix linting before release**: Always run npm run lint before publishing (effectiveness: 1)
- **Automatic by default**: Make tools work without manual intervention - users should get value immediately (effectiveness: 1)
#### High Priority
- **Dogfooding validates design**: Using your own product reveals real usability issues and missing features (effectiveness: 0.95)
- **Selective git strategy**: Commit curated knowledge (CLAUDE.md) but keep personal memory private (.claude/ folder) (effectiveness: 0.9)
#### Medium Priority
- **Cost transparency builds trust**: Being upfront about initial costs vs long-term savings helps users make informed decisions (effectiveness: 0.85)
